# networked-applications

This repository contains a collection of my projects related to **Networked Applications**, implemented using both **Python** and **Java**. These projects demonstrate my understanding and proficiency in building applications that involve networking concepts such as client-server communication, APIs, and more.

## Overview

The repository showcases various networked application projects built in Python and Java. These projects focus on creating systems that communicate over networks, implementing various protocols, handling data transmission, and ensuring secure and efficient communication between systems.

## Projects

### 1. **Python Projects**
- **Software Defined Network (SDN) Applications**: Objective is to highlight the difference between a traditional networking and SDN. Learn about OpenFlow, Mininet, and how to write a simple application at the controller in "NOX/POX" for configuring SDN-enabled switches running OpenFlow.
- **Simple Application creation using Containers**: Objective of this is to help learners understand the practical use of containers, particularly Docker.

### 2. **Java Projects**
- **Socket Programming and Concurrency**: Objective is to write a simple client-server network application using Java socket programming API. Also, to learn simple concurrency control techniques in a multithreaded program.
- **RPC & RMI**: Objective is to write a simple client-server network application using the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) or the Remote Method Invocation (RMI) system.
